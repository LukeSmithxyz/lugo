# Luke's Hugo Theme

A simple Hugo theme I plan on using for my personal website, [Based.Cooking](https://based.cooking) and [LandChad.net](https://landchad.net).

## get started

```sh
hugo new site new-site
cd new-site
git clone https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/lugo themes/lugo
echo "theme = 'lugo'" >> config.toml
touch static/custom.css  # put your style changes into that file
```

## stuff

- Makes one RSS feed for the entire site at `/index.xml`
- Stylesheet is in `/style.css` and includes some important stuff for partials.
- If a post is tagged, links to the tags are placed at the bottom of the post.
- `nextprev.html` adds links to the Next and Previous articles to the bottom of a page.
- `taglist.html` links all tags an article is tagged to for related content.
